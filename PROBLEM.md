# Problem Statement: Make a dynamic counter which updates on click

### 1. Create a new project with 'create-react-app' with appropriate commands.
### 2. Once the project is made, remove all the default code provided and start with a clean slate to make your own components.
### 3. Following are the requirements - 
 - When you click on "Add a button", a new button should be added on the screen, with the "Button X", where "X" represents the number of button
 - Also, as soon as you click on "Add a button", The counter above should update to the total number of buttons on screen. In the example below, you can see it  says "Counter - 2", as there are 2 buttons currently on screen.
 - After adding the buttons on screen, you can click on those buttons, and with respect to whatever button is clicked, another counter called "Last button clicked" will update to the button number which was clicked. For example, if you click - "Button 2", the "Last button counter - 2" should be seen on screen, and if "Button 15" is clicked, then "Last button counter - 3" should be seen.
### 4. Use the below image to take the reference.
